# Above All Aviation Schedule Parser
The flight school I'm attending, Above All Aviation, does their scheduling using [MyFbo](https://www.myfbo.com/). They don't provide any student login to easily download the schedule, and instead send email notifications. There's a lot of lessons, and I wanted an easier way to import them into my schedule!

Whenever I make large schedule changes, they send my entire schedule to me via email. 

I use this tool to help me parse the events, and add them into a google calendar, deleting all previous events.
